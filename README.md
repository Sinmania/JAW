An open-source, prototype implementation of property graphs for javascript based on the [esprima](https://github.com/jquery/esprima/tree/master/src) parser, and the [Mozilla SpiderMonkey Parser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API).
This project is licensed under `GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3.0`. See [here](LICENSE) for more information.

# Setup

## Prerequisites
Please install the following dependencies before proceeding to the installation step:
- latest version of `npm package manager` (node js)
- any stable version of `python 3.x`
- python `pip` package manager


## Installation

Please follow the steps below in order for an smooth installation process.

### Step 1: Installing Python Dependencies
In the project root directory, run:
```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Installing Node Modules
In the project root directory, run:
```sh
$ cd wpg_construction
$ npm install
```
Then:
```sh
$ cd wpg_construction/lib/jaw/dom-points-to
$ npm install
```
Finally:
```sh
$ cd wpg_construction/lib/jaw/normalization
$ npm install
```

### Step 3: Installing Neo4j

**1- Install Java.**

Follow the tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manually-install-oracle-java-on-a-debian-or-ubuntu-vps) to install the latest version of Java.


**2- Install Neo4j.**

This prototype have been tested with `Neo4j 3.5.9`, community edition.

```sh
$ chmod +x neo4j_installation.sh
$ ./neo4j_installation.sh
```
For more information, see [](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/installing-neo4j-on-ubuntu-16-04_594570).


**3- Set the intitial Neo4j Password.**

By default, the password should be set as `root` for the user `neo4j`. If you set any other password, you also need to change it in `constants.py`.
```sh
$ neo4j-admin set-initial-password root
```

**Note**: the default username and password should be `neo4j` and `neo4j`, respectively. But this has to be changed so that neo4j allows `driver connections`. If the above command did not work, try using the `cypher-shell`:

connect to cypher shell via:
```sh
$ cypher-shell -u neo4j -p neo4j
```
then run:
```sh
CALL dbms.changePassword('root');
:exit
```

If you choose a different password, you must set it in `.env` with `NEO4J_PASS=your-password`.


**4- Make sure you can see the followings (uncommented) in your `neo4j.conf` file:**
```
dbms.connector.bolt.enabled=true
dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=0.0.0.0:7687 
```

### Step 4: Setup Enviornment Variables

Copy the `example.env`  and rename it to `.env`.
- Set your operating system:
	- `PLATFORM=linux`
	- `PLATFORM=macos`
- If you choose a different password than that of step 3, you must set it in `.env` with `NEO4J_PASS=your-password`.

**Note**: you may use the tool in windows. This requires changing the `neo4j` configuration varibles (e.g., NEO4J_CONF) in `constants.py`. In addition, you should change the
`API_neo4j_prepare` function in `main.py` by replacing the `sed` bash command to that of windows (or simply provide a similar copying logic).

### Further Information about Neo4j

Neo4j example DB import synax:
```sh
$ neo4j-admin import --mode=csv --database=graph.db --nodes=nodes.csv --relationships=rels.csv --delimiter='Â¿'
```
See: [Neo4j import documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/import/) for more!


Environment configuration on OS X:
```sh
$ export NEO4J_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/neo4j/3.5.9/libexec"
```


# Using JAW in 2 Steps
You can create WPGs, import them into a neo4j database, and query the database as follows:

## Step 1: Graph Construction
In order to create a property graph and import it to an active neo4j database, you can use the following command:

```sh
$ python3 -m wpg_construction.api <path> --js=<program.js> --import=<bool> --hybrid=<bool> --reqs=<requests.out> --evts=<events.out> --cookies=<cookies.pkl> --html=<html_snapshot.html>
```

For help regarding the meaning of each option in the above command, please use the help CLI provided with the graph construction API:
```sh
$ python3 -m wpg_construction.api -h
```

Alternatively, you can use the following two steps. This is especially suited for debugging purposes.

### Building the Graph CSV Files
The javascript analyzer modules creates the `nodes.csv` and `rels.csv` files for analysis (the web property graph).

In the project root directory, try:
```sh
$ node wpg_construction/main.js -js <RELATIVE_PATH_TO_TEST_FILE> -o <OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME>
```
For example:
```sh
$ node wpg_construction/main.js -js wpg_construction/test-inputs/test.js -o myfolder
```

### Importing into Neo4j

In the project root directory, run:
```sh
$ python3 -m wpg_neo4j.wpg_import <path-to-the-folder-of-the-csv-files> --nodes=nodes.csv --edges=rels.csv
```
Help CLI:
```sh
$ python3 -m wpg_neo4j.wpg_import -h

```

### Step 2: Graph Traversals and Declarative Queries
You can use Cypher Queries or the NeoModel ORM to query the property graph. The NeoModel ORM Schema is defined in `wpg_neo4j/orm.py`.
You should place and run your queries in `wpg_analysis/<ANALYSIS_NAME>`. For further details, see the example query files provided: `example.orm.py` and `example.py` in the `wpg_analysis/example` folder.

```sh
$ python3 -m wpg_analysis.example.example
$ python3 -m wpg_analysis.example.exampleorm  
```


## Graph Traversals and Analysis of Client-side CSRF
This will build the property graph, creates a neo4j database and queries the database. 

**Note**: Please change or set the appropriate run mode in `main.py` for debugging purposes!
```sh
$ python3 -m wpg_analysis.cs_csrf.main
```


# Web Crawling and Websites Under Test (Inputs)
The site inital address and its `state scripts` are **inputs** of the tool. The file `wpg_crawler/sites/sitemap.py` contains the list of sites for testing. 
- Each site is given a `site_id` which specifies the folder name used to store the site `state scripts` (e.g., login as admininstrator, login as user 1, login as user 2, logout, etc). 
- To create a new site entry, copy the `sites/template` and rename it to `sites/<SITE_ID>` where <SITE_ID> is the integer you set in `sitemap.py`.
- Change the template `state script` in `sites/<SITE_ID>/scripts/Auth.py` via your implementaion for your own site.

## How to Run URL Crawler Module?
In order to start the crawler and collect the sites data, run the driver program for data collection module in root directory:
```sh
$ cd wpg_crawler
$ python3 driver.py <site-id>
``` 
For more information about the web crawler of JAW, see [here](docs/crawler.md).
